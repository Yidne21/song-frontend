# Song CRUD Frontend

This project is the frontend part of a full-stack MERN application for managing songs. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete songs, as well as view statistical data about songs, albums, artists, and genres. The frontend communicates with a backend REST API to perform these operations.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, update, delete, and view a list of songs.
- **Statistics Section**: Displays statistics such as the total number of songs, albums, artists, and genres.
- **Filtering**: Allows filtering by genre, title and etc for ease of navigation.
- **State Management**: The app uses Redux Toolkit for state management and Redux-Saga for handling asynchronous calls.
